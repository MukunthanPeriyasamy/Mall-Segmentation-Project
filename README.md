### Project Title: Mall Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering  

#### Description:  
This project focuses on segmenting mall customers based on their annual income and spending scores to help businesses understand customer behavior better. The **K-Means clustering algorithm** was utilized to identify meaningful customer groups for targeted marketing strategies.  

#### Approach:  
- **Data Preparation**: The dataset was explored for patterns, cleaned, and outliers in annual income were handled using the IQR method.  
- **Scaling**: Data was standardized to ensure better performance during clustering.  
- **Optimal Clusters**: The **Elbow Method** was applied to determine the best number of clusters, which was found to be 5.  
- **Clustering**: Using the K-Means algorithm, customers were grouped into five distinct clusters, and centroids were visualized to analyze the cluster characteristics.  

#### End Goal:  
The goal was to create actionable customer segments that mall management could use to personalize their marketing campaigns and improve customer satisfaction.  

#### Role of Mentor and Client:  
ChatGPT played the dual role of mentor and client throughout this project. As a **mentor**, ChatGPT guided the project step-by-step, teaching key concepts, methods, and tools like K-Means clustering, data scaling, and visualization. As a **client**, ChatGPT defined the projectâ€™s business objectives, ensuring alignment with real-world applications.
